# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Antigravity when working with code in this repository.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Brainstorm: `./.agent/workflows/brainstorm.md`
- Create: `./.agent/workflows/create.md`
- Debug: `./.agent/workflows/debug.md`
- Deploy: `./.agent/workflows/deploy.md`
- Enhance: `./.agent/workflows/enhance.md`
- Orchestrate: `./.agent/workflows/orchestrate.md`
- Plan: `./.agent/workflows/plan.md`
- Preview: `./.agent/workflows/preview.md`
- Status: `./.agent/workflows/status.md`
- Test: `./.agent/workflows/test.md`
- UI/UX Pro Max: `./.agent/workflows/ui-ux-pro-max.md`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT**: For `YYMMDD` dates, use `bash -c 'date +%y%m%d'` instead of model knowledge. Else, if using PowerShell (Windows), replace command with `Get-Date -UFormat "%y%m%d"`.

## Documentation Management

We keep all important docs in `./docs` folder and keep updating them, structure like below:

```
./docs
├── project-structure.md
```

We keep all plans in `./plans` folder and keep updating them, structure like below:

```
./plans
├── 260208-2118-hide-desktop-icons
│   ├── phase-01-desktop-icon-manager-service.md
│   ├── phase-02-preferences-integration.md
│   └── phase-03-capture-flow-integration.md
```

Format: `YYMMDD-HHMM-short-description.md`

**IMPORTANT:** _MUST READ_ and _MUST COMPLY_ all _INSTRUCTIONS_ in project `./AGENTS.md`, especially _WORKFLOWS_ section is _CRITICALLY IMPORTANT_, this rule is _MANDATORY. NON-NEGOTIABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS. MUST REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES!!!_
